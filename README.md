# Full Backend With Javascript

[Model Link](https://app.eraser.io/workspace/YtPqZ1VogxGy1jzIDkzj)

This project is a fully-fledged backend system that I have developed using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, bcrypt, and more. It is designed to power a video hosting platform, similar to YouTube, with comprehensive features including user authentication (login/signup), video uploads, likes, dislikes, commenting with replies, and subscription management.

Throughout this project, I implemented industry-standard practices such as JWT for secure user sessions, bcrypt for password hashing, and a robust token management system with access and refresh tokens. This project has been a significant learning experience, providing hands-on exposure to creating scalable and secure backend architectures.
